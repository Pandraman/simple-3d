# simple-3d
The simplest of 3d engines



Very simple meaning, currently no lighting, no real rotation, only importing and viewing OBJs.
This is a project I've been putting of for far too long, and now that I finally installed SFML on my PC 
I'll be working on this as a side Project.
Feel free to adapt, modify or even - if you dare - use this code
